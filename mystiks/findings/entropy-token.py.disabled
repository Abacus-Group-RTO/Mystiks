        'API tokens are a type of authentication mechanism that is used to grant access to API resources. It is a unique identifier that is generated by the API server and is used by the API client to authenticate itself during API requests. API tokens are commonly used in RESTful web services and APIs to authorize access to protected resources. The token is usually generated by the API provider when the user or client application first registers with the API server.',

If an API token is exposed, it can be used by anyone to access the API and potentially perform unauthorized actions. This can be especially dangerous if the API provides access to sensitive information or functionality. Therefore, it is important to keep API tokens secure and limit their exposure to only authorized users and systems.'
